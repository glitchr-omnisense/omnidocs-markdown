# Transparent (navigation)

`src/js/transparent.js` - links and forms load the next page in the background
and the page's block (`identifier`, `#page` by default) is swapped in place,
with the history, the scroll positions, the head and the scripts kept in step.
Needs jQuery and the core.

```js
import '@glitchr/flowjs/navigation';

Transparent.ready({ identifier: '#page', prefetch: true, nest: ['/admin/*'] });
```

After each swap the page announces `transparent:load` (the stops, the sticky
effects and the other modules attach themselves again to the new page through
the core). A link with `rel="prefetch"` is fetched when the pointer settles on it.

## Options (`Transparent.settings`)

Set with `Transparent.ready({...})` or `Transparent.configure({...})`.

| Option | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `identifier` | `"#page"` | the block swapped |
| `loader` | `"#loader"` | |
| `throttle` | `1000` | |
| `rescue_reload` | `5000` | |
| `lazyload` | `true` | |
| `exceptions` | `[]` | paths (RegExp or wildcard strings) left to the browser |
| `prefetch` | `true` | only anchors with `rel="prefetch"` are fetched ahead; `false` switches the mechanism off |
| `prefetch_delay` | `65` | ms the pointer dwells before the fetch |
| `prefetch_ttl` | `30000` | ms a prefetched page stays usable |
| `prefetch_max` | `15` | |
| `exit_duration` | `0` | ms `html.exiting` is held after the response arrives, before the swap (plain milliseconds) |
| `smoothscroll_duration` / `_speed` / `_easing` | `"200ms"` / `0` / `"swing"` | |
| `headlock` | `[]` | URL substrings or patterns kept in `<head>` across pages; `data-headlock="true"` / `"false"` on an element overrides |
| `use_view_transitions` | `false` | wrap the swap in `document.startViewTransition()` where supported |
| `skip_transition_for_cache` | `false` | cache hits skip the view transition |
| `progress_bar` | `true` | a native bar while `html.loading` is set; `false` or `'off'` for another indicator |
| `cache_version` | `null` | a value changing at each deploy purges the response cache on mismatch |
| `nest` | `[]` | path patterns opened as a nested website-in-website panel; the target must send the `X-Transparent-Nest` header |
| `nest_move`, `nest_resize`, `nest_snap` | `true` | drag the chrome bar, resize by the edges, magnetic snapping |
| `nest_snap_threshold` | `8` | px |
| `nest_dock` | `true` | docking against an edge; `nest_dock_target` (`null`) names an element to dock into |
| `nest_swipe` | `true` | small screens: drag the bar down to dismiss |
| `nest_keepalive` | `true` | closing parks the nested session, the next open resumes it |
| `nest_remember` | `true` | the panel's layout is kept in localStorage under `nest_remember_key` (`"transparent[nest][layout]"`) |
| `nest_esc_confirm` | `"Close this panel? Any unsaved changes may be lost."` | confirm before ESC closes a nest |
| `disable`, `debug` | `false` | |

The comments above each option in `src/js/transparent.js` give the reasoning.

## Back, Forward, and a page that is not whole yet

A page left by a link, by Back or by Forward is kept as it is (its DOM in
memory for five minutes, its HTML in `sessionStorage`), with the scroll
position of the window and of every element that scrolls. Coming back, it is
given its place again - and that place is held while the page finishes
growing (sections a controller sizes, pictures without dimensions): put back
at each change of size, the browser's scroll anchoring off meanwhile, until
the page has been quiet for 1.5 s (6 s at most). The reader taking the scroll
(a wheel, a finger, a press, a key), a script of the page scrolling it, or the
next navigation ends the hold at once.

The kept page includes what scripts added to it. `transparent:beforeunload`
is dispatched before a page is kept: the moment to take away what should not
come back with it.

## A request that gets no answer

When the connection drops or the server cannot be reached (status 0, nothing
received), the page stays as it is, at its address, and is announced again as
a swap announces one (`DOMContentLoaded`, `transparent:load`, `load`): what a
site put on for the wait - a curtain, a progress bar - comes off through the
handlers it already has. jQuery's `ajaxError` tells the failure.

## A page under another status than 200

A status does not make an answer unusable. When the answer is a page of the
site - the block the navigation swaps (`identifier`) is in it, in a layout it
can swap - it is shown like any other: in place, at its address, with its
history entry (which keeps the status), and nothing is said in the console.
That is a form the server refuses, sent back with its errors under 422 (what
Symfony answers for an invalid form), a creation under 201, and the site's
own page for what is missing, forbidden or broken (404, 403, 500, 503).

An answer that is no such page - a proxy's 502, a debug trace, a bare server
error - is a failure: `Transparent.rescue()` says so in the console
(`Rescue mode.. called`; `Unexpected XHR response` for a 5xx), replaces the
document with what came, and `Transparent.isRescueMode()` is `true` from
then on.
